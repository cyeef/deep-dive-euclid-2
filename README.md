# deep-dive-euclid
euclids program using GCD(a-b)=c
largest rod a and largest rod b divided by c
whatever divides the largest stick will divide the smallest stick until all is equal
make alogorithims without ambiguouity
psuedo code phrases that look like code
int  a and int be with args 0  and args 1 array index out of bounds runtime exceptioms
this code will give you the common denomitor of two values or return the value of zero when a number is 
divided by zero
we changed the executable file of the Euclid Classical Alogrithim to a Modular division
